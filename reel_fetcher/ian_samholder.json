The water just went into the ocean and we should be livid. Approximately 24,000,000,000,000 (24 trillion) gallons of water fell and we saved very little of it, what a sad waste California. What a waste! This could‚Äôve taken us out of a very scary water situation. \n\nI‚Äôm hoping that we can find a balance of protecting wildlife, but also saving the precious water we need that is falling like a GIFT out of the sky‚Ä¶ Do what we need to save it while protecting delicate species down stream.

October 13, 2021 I can proudly say that Brothers Bond Bourbon aka @brothersbondbourbon has OFFICIALLY purchased regenerative grain that will be going into barrels. The incredible farm practicing age ‚Äì old regenerative agriculture Will blow you away. I will be able to share soon. The story, the history and the importance of this farm to regenerate soil, revitalize freshwater stores and sequester carbon to save our planet will give you goosebumps or make your eyes teary. \nAfter endless and amazing conversations with my @kisstheground team/family and these farmers, we are on our way. Our Commitment as  @brothersbondbourbon to the planet, humanity and all the creatures is strong and focused. We believe With steadfast conviction that it is up to companies to make the crucial shift to regenerative agriculture. It is going to be for profit companies, not nonprofits or governments that are going to make this shift possible. It‚Äôs better for farmers, it‚Äôs better for the economy, it‚Äôs better for people and it‚Äôs better for the planet. The science is there. We have the tools. The fact that we can slow climate change to a crawl, while farmers make more money, people have access to more nutritious  food and wildlife can thrive should make us all want to JUMP UP AND DOWN SCREAMING WITH EXCITEMENT. Please jump with me. When every student in every school demands that every product they eat on their campuses come from regenerative farms the world will change. When every mall development, airport restaurant, local and National chain restaurants and every grocery store \nSwitch to even 25% regenerative products the world will change. The future is here. It is time for farmers to prosper like the brokers and the retailers. They feed us, we must feed them. We got this. I can‚Äôt wait to share more details. Article coming soon!",

Understanding how to harness the power of social media in our homes, schools, boardrooms and political chambers to avoid the perils. #TheHypeMachine is a MUST READ for us all NO MATTER what side of the political spectrum you fall under. While I reading this book- I felt like I was sitting in a planetarium watching the constellations of how information travels unfold before my eyes. It made me feel armed with understanding... This is about how information travels. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT-IT IS SCARY. Why do we need to know this? Simple. We‚Äôre all digesting what seems like the equivalent of POUNDS AND POUNDS of information per day/week/month/year. Is it healthy? What info is real and what is false has a huge bearing on how we steer our own ships and weather the storms of our new digital age. The mental and emotional health of us AND society. This is another example of my brother crushing it in the world for the greater good. So grateful. So proud. 20 years of research and 4 years of writing; that‚Äôs dedication to us all.

If we want real change we must then change perception. Change the paradigm. Change the perspective. Its called unity. It is called, equality. In a time when we need unity, love, intelligence, compassion&equality more than ever in history; we are as divided as we were in 1863 and 1963 or 1968. How is that possible? In a time when we are facing a deteriorating climate already causing widespread economic loss, threatening our food systems, destroying our oceans, destroying our freshwater supplies punishing us with violent weather. \nHow you ask? Systemic racism, social injustice&environmental injustice. How can we not see its all connected? WE, are all connected. We are responsible for this by not doing something about it. \nThose three things are at the core of our cracking foundation. We fix it-we fix our foundation, we help our people and we help our world sustain us. We must Invest in education. We must invest in communities and invest in unity. We need leadership in consumerism, leadership in government, leadership in business and across the board. We must understand history FIRST so that we will stop this cycle NOW and forever.\nStart exploring history and start researching BEYOND what your algorithm feeds you. Algorithms may be great for companies, governments and science that need/want mass amounts of information ‚Äì I feel they are detrimental to society. They silently keep us in our own echo chambers without us even knowing.\nWhen you peer out of your periscope from your deep Instagram/social media opium den, you‚Äôll see a world rich with history, culture and tolerance that is CRUCIAL for us to understand. We can only know how to move forward, if we know what‚Äôs behind us. If history repeats itself, then how can you stop that repeating if you don‚Äôt know what happened in the past? Did you learn about the 1921 Tulsa Massacre in school? Nope. They don‚Äôt teach it. I learned it from my football coach in high school. How is THAT possible? I always remember this: History is told by its VICTORS. Cont‚Äôd in comments",

As a species, I am confident that we will come together to live much more harmoniously with one another and live infinitely more harmoniously with our beautiful planet. As we approach the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, I am so grateful that our film KISS THE GROUND @kisstheground Was selected and going to be premiering at Tribeca film Festival in New York next week. While, I am sad that I don‚Äôt get to be there to do this with our amazing team and so many of you, I cannot wait to show you our film. The hard work and the beauty that is the message of this film will inspire you. I promise. I hope. Thank you so very much @tribecafilmfestival , what an honor... I just wanted to drop a note to share some of the stuff coming down the pipeline for me that I can‚Äôt wait to share with you all. I obviously did not want to say anything that would seem tone deaf in these strange and harsh times in our world. I didn‚Äôt want to project into the world my creative, business and philanthropic projects and the waves of change they will bring until it was absolutely time. Now is that time. Any positivity helps. I know it‚Äôs hard out there, we are all getting slammed. Truly. I know we will rise like the phoenix from the ashes of this mess. From another vista: Our planet is healing though (even as we reset and suffer)  and we now see what large-scale efforts can do to our help make our world healthy and thrive. Our planet and it‚Äôs soil is the source of our immunity and if we heal the planet-the air land and sea- it will heal us. This I can promise. Stay safe out there everyone. I miss you...",

The last time I posted this only had about 380,000 views and I felt that this message, in these tough times may feel nice and warrants many more eyes and souls on it . From me as a fellow human to YOU as a fellow human please watch this with headphones. What great perspective, he truly is a hero of humanity. I am so I truly moved by what he is saying that I‚Äôd like to put back out to you again. I promise it‚Äôs not a waste of time. It‚Äôs quite deep though and sometimes that makes us uncomfortable... Here‚Äôs what I would say: Want a tiny break from the day or just something peaceful to think about before you drift off to sleep? As a human being. If your put your headphones on&really watch&listen I think you may look around a bit differently today/tonight... I hope this inspires you as much as it inspires me on a daily basis. This excerpt from Carl Sagan's book Pale Blue Dot (1994) was inspired by an image taken, at Sagan's suggestion, by Voyager 1 on Feb 14, 1990.  From a distance of about 6 billion km, Voyager 1, which had completed its primary mission and was leaving the Solar System, was commanded by NASA to turn its camera around and take one last photo of Earth across a great expanse of space, at the request of Carl Sagan. The accompanying words, written 27 yrs ago are still relevant today.",

There are over 50 thousand people displaced across the state of Louisiana and there are also countless schools that have been damaged AND pets in need of supplies and shelter!! Over the last week we've been working with a wonderful team over at CrowdRise to set up these pages as well as the First Lady of Louisiana Donna Edwards in an effort to bring assistance to the Louisiana School Boards Association (LSBA) to assist flood-damaged schools throughout South Louisiana. The LSBA will help schools provide classroom supplies, school uniforms, technology equipment, structural repairs, clean-up costs and other needed aid. These schools and fur babies of Louisiana need our help!! WE ARE ALSO raising funds for the Louisiana State Animal Response team (a division of Dr. Walter J. Ernst, Jr. Veterinary Memorial Foundation (WJE). They are doing an amazing job coordinating animal rescues in Louisiana by monitoring floodwaters and distributing teams to assist with rescue efforts!! Supplies are important, safety and vet care and shelter is important, food is important and restoring a sense of normalcy is so so important! Please join us!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!!
